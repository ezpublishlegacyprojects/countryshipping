Description
===========

A shipping handler and a datatype to add custom shipping for a product
depending on country and currency.

The datatype makes it possible to add different shipping based on currency and
country. You can also set additional shipping for each extra item you buy from
a product.


Installation
============

1. Unpack the extension under the "extension" directory of your eZ publish
installation.
2. Update your database with the updates in
   extension/countryshipping/update/database/mysql/countryshipping.sql

Log into the admin interface:
3. Add the extension countryshipping in (/setup/extensions) or edit your
site.ini.append.php file and add:
   [ExtensionSettings]
   ActiveExtensions[]=countryshipping

4. Add your currency in the webshop (/shop/currencylist).

Clear cache on the site.

Now it should be possible to add a new class attribute Shipping to your product
class.

You should also be able to add a shipping group (/ezshipping/grouplist), which
can be a common shipping configuration for many products.


Usage
=====

First you should ensure that all the currencies you want to use are added in
the the currency list. (Webshop -> Currencies (/shop/currencylist).

When the extension is installed, you'll get a new tab in the admin interface
called Shipping. This is an own module where you can add shipping groups which
contains shippinginformation that can be shared between several products.

To use the new datatype, edit you product class and add the new datatype
Shipping, which can can be selected from the dropdown when you add a new
attribute for the content class.

Description of the different input fields.
- Shipping group:
  * Custom will use the default values that you enter below in the class
    definition.
  * The additional fields will use the values from the Shipping group, which
    are added in the Shipping tab.

- Default currency: 
  Will be used as a base vaule for calculating the autogenerated values if the
  autorate is used. The autorate can be set when you edit the currency itself.

- Default Shipping:
  * First value: The price that will be added for the first item of the product
    you buy.
  * Additional value: The price that will be added for each item you add
    additionally to the first item.
